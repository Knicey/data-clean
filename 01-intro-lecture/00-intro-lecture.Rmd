Course Objectives
===

- Provide a foundation to statistical machine learning
- Understand the fundamentals of data cleaning and record linkage 
- Understand data cleaning applications and their importance in machine learning 
- Provide a basic understanding of data cleaning methods and algorithms
- Learn to effectively communicate methods/algorithms/results through written assignments and exams 



Missed class/review material?
===

Go to [https://github.com/resteorts/modern-bayes/](https://github.com/resteorts/data-clean/) and fork the repository. 

- Make sure to pull the repository each day. I update the repository very often as all the course resources are here (homeworks, lectures, data). If you don't pull often, you might run into some issues!


Class Meetings 
===

- Learn about statistical machine learning
- Lectures will consist of learning methodology and applied coding techniques
- You might find it useful to have a tablet/document camera for homeworks/OH/exams
- An alternative to this is using your phone to take pictures using Evernote (students have said this worked well in the spring). Please test things out in advance and make sure things are legible! 

Labs
===

- Lab will be used as an opportunity to work with teaching assistants on course content and questions


    

Activities & Assessments
===

- <font class="vocab">Homework</font>: Individual assignments combining conceptual and computational skills along with lab exercises. *Lowest score dropped.*


- <font class="vocab">Labs</font>: **Attending lab is highly encouraged** but not required. The goal is to learn about modern statistical machine learning methods. 

- <font class="vocab">Class/Lab</font>: **You will be responsible for keeping up with all class, reading, and homework material on a weekly basis.

Class Engagement
===

0. Students are expected to have read any assigned reading before coming to class. 
1. Professor Steorts will prepare slides regarding material and go through these during class. 
2. Students are encouraged to ask questions and engage in class. 
3. The purpose of homeworks and exams will be to test the understanding of the course knowledge from the course material. 




Homeworks
===

1. All code must be written to be reproducible in Markdown. 
2. All derivations can be done in any format of your choosing (word, latex, markdown, written by hand) but must be converted to a pdf document. It must be legible.
3. You reproducible Rmd file is uploaded to Canvas. Your PDF file is uploaded to Gradescope. 
4. Ask questions early if you have a problem to a TA regarding submission issues. 
5. Your lowest homework will be dropped. 

Remark: Canvas is for reproducible code. Gradescope is to make grading easier for everyone. Unfortunately, there is not a platform that handles both. 

**Please see the syllabus for all homework guidelines.**

Why Canvas + Gradescope?
===

1. Canvas will be used for reproducibility so this can be checked. This will account for part of your grade each assignment. 

2. Gradescope will be used to:

- return homework/exams more promptly
- ensure  complete  fairness
- allow  students  to  continue  to  learn  from  homeworks  by  reworking problems  without  the  right  answer  written  out  to  the  side


Exams
===

The format of the exams will be discussed closer to the time of the exam. At this time, plan to be for the exams in person unless there is an announcement about this. 

Grade Calculation
===

<small>

| Component | Weight |
|---------------|--------|
| Homework | 30%|
| Exam 1 | 20% |
| Exam 2 | 20% |
| Exam 3 | 30% |

- See the syllabus for grade breakdowns. 
- Grades will **never** be curved down. 
- You are expected to attend lectures and labs in order to keep up with the course material.
- There will be no attendance grade or participation grade. 


Absences
===

- Students who miss a class due to a scheduled varsity trip, religious holiday, or short-term illness should fill out the respective form.
     - These excused absences do not excuse you from assigned work. 

- If you have a personal or family emergency or chronic health condition that affects your ability to participate in class, please contact myself and or your academic deanâ€™s office.

- Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. 

- What if I have COVID symptoms? 
  - Please do not come to class or return to class until you are cleared to come back. Forms can be found here:
  https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/illness


Late Work and Regrade Requests
===

- No late homeworks will be accepted, so please do not ask.  
    
- No make up exams will be given.  

- Regrade requests must be submitted within one week of when the assignment was returned. 

Academic Honesty
===

All work for this class should be done in accordance with the Duke Community Standard. 

To uphold the Duke Community Standard:

- I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
- I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
- I will act if the Standard is compromised.
Any violations will automatically result in a grade of 0 on the assignment and will be reported to [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct) for further action.

Reusing Code
===

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must or explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

- On individual assignments, you may discuss the assignment with one another; however, you may not directly share code or write up with other students. 

- On team assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.

Where to find help
===

- **If you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it!** There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

- **Office Hours**: A lot of questions are most effectively answered in office hours, so please take advantage of these.

- Canvas: Outside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the forum since there are likely other students with the same questions. **Please be careful not to give away the answers to homework questions and please keep it polite/friendly on the forum.**

Academic Resource Center
===

Sometimes you may need help with the class that is beyond what can be provided by the teaching team. In that instance, I encourage you to visit the Academic Resource Center.

Technology/Other
===

- Make sure that you have your zoom ids organized so that you're not late for class. 
- Ensure the volume on all devices is set to mute.
- Refrain from engaging in activities not related to the class discussion. Browsing the web and social media, excessive messaging, playing games, etc. is not only a distraction for you but is also a distraction for everyone around you.
- If you have a question, I don't mind if you interrupt me during class. 
- If you find a **typo in the slides**, please write these down and post these privately to the instructors on Canvas so they can be fixed.
